Execute the research according to the plan (or additional research instructions).

**What to do:**
1. Execute planned research items in order
2. Actually investigate each item (web search, codebase search, etc.)
3. Report items that could not be researched as "Unable to research"
4. Save research data to `{report_dir}/data-{topic-name}.md` as files
5. Organize results and create a report

**External data downloads:**
- Actively download and utilize CSV, Excel, JSON, and other data files from public institutions and trusted sources
- Always verify source reliability before downloading (government agencies, academic institutions, official corporate sites, etc.)
- Save downloaded files to `{report_dir}/`
- Never download from suspicious domains or download executable files

**Data saving rules:**
- Write data per research item to `{report_dir}/data-{topic-name}.md`
- Topic names in lowercase English with hyphens (e.g., `data-market-size.md`)
- Include source URLs, retrieval dates, and raw data

**Report structure:**
- Results and details per research item
- Summary of key findings
- Caveats and risks
- Items unable to research and reasons
- Recommendations/conclusions
