Decompose the research plan (or additional research instructions) into independent subtasks and execute the investigation in parallel.

**What to do:**
1. Analyze research items from the plan and decompose them into independently executable subtasks
2. Include clear research scope and expected deliverables in each subtask's instruction
3. Include the following data saving rules and report structure in each subtask's instruction

**Subtask decomposition guidelines:**
- Prioritize topic independence (group interdependent items into the same subtask)
- Avoid spreading high-priority items (P1) across too many subtasks
- Balance workload evenly across subtasks

**Rules to include in each subtask's instruction:**

Data saving rules:
- Write data per research item to `{report_dir}/data-{topic-name}.md`
- Topic names in lowercase English with hyphens (e.g., `data-market-size.md`)
- Include source URLs, retrieval dates, and raw data

External data downloads:
- Actively download and utilize CSV, Excel, JSON, and other data files from public institutions and trusted sources
- Always verify source reliability before downloading
- Save downloaded files to `{report_dir}/`
- Never download from suspicious domains or download executable files

Report structure (per subtask):
- Results and details per research item
- Summary of key findings
- Caveats and risks
- Items unable to research and reasons
- Recommendations/conclusions
