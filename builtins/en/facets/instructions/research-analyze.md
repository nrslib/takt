Analyze the research results and determine whether additional investigation is needed.

**What to do:**
1. Organize the major findings from the research results
2. Identify unexplained phenomena, unverified hypotheses, and missing data
3. Save analysis results to `{report_dir}/analysis-{N}.md` as files
4. Make one of the following judgments:
   - **New questions exist** → Create additional research instructions for the Digger
   - **Sufficiently investigated** → Create an overall summary

**Data saving rules:**
- Write to `{report_dir}/analysis-{N}.md` (N is sequential number) for each analysis
- Include analysis perspective, synthesized findings, and identified gaps

**Additional research instruction format:**
- What to investigate (specific data or information)
- Why it's needed (which gap it fills)
- Where it might be found (hints for data sources)

**Overall summary structure:**
- Summary of findings so far
- Organization of findings
- Identified gaps and their importance (if remaining)
