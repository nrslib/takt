| {assumption or wiring} | {code, existing use, and test} | {verified result or unverified} |
## Re-scan Evidence
| Checked Chapters | Unverified Chapters (only when any) | Checked Route | Current Evidence | Result |

## Finding Contract Claims
{Describe every observed defect or explicit ledger lifecycle claim here separately. If the injected instructions require structured output, use that schema as the machine format; otherwise return only the Markdown report. Do not use a findings table. If there are no claims, write `None`.}

## Output Consistency
- When an injected structured-output schema is present, every issue described in the report must also appear in that structured output. Otherwise use ordinary report prose only. Do not assign final finding IDs.
- APPROVE means zero issues; REJECT means one or more issues. Do not make approvals or summaries issues.
```

**Cognitive-load rule:** Even for APPROVE, include the one aggregated re-scan row; group locations with the same cause. Keep verification evidence concise, but do not omit or truncate any machine claim required by the active Finding Contract format.
