## Finding Contract Claims
{Describe every observed defect or explicit ledger lifecycle claim here separately. If the injected instructions require structured output, use that schema as the machine format; otherwise return only the Markdown report. Do not use a findings table. If there are no claims, write `None`.}

## Output Consistency
- When an injected structured-output schema is present, every issue described in the report must also appear in that structured output. Otherwise use ordinary report prose only. Do not assign final finding IDs.
- APPROVE means zero issues; REJECT means one or more issues. Do not make approvals or summaries issues.

## Rejection Gate
- REJECT only when at least one blocking finding is observed
```

**Cognitive load reduction rules:**
- APPROVE with no lifecycle claims → Summary only
- APPROVE with confirmations → Summary and the required claims in the active Finding Contract format
- REJECT → Include every related claim and necessary resolution confirmation in the active Finding Contract format
