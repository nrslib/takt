# Testing Review

## Result: APPROVE / REJECT

## Summary
{Summarize the result in 1-2 sentences}

## Reviewed Aspects
| Aspect | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Test coverage | ✅ | - |
| Test structure (Given-When-Then) | ✅ | - |
| Test naming | ✅ | - |
| Test independence & reproducibility | ✅ | - |
| Mocks & fixtures | ✅ | - |
| Test strategy (unit/integration/E2E) | ✅ | - |
| Contract input location (body/query/path) | ✅ | - |

## Problem-Family Completion Sweep
| family_tag / changed contract | Invariant or root cause | Definition, production, validation | Consumption, persistence, reinjection | Failure, interruption, retry, resume, parallel, auxiliary entries | Mocks, fixtures, test doubles | Unchecked paths | Result |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| {problem family or contract reviewed} | {condition to preserve} | {locations checked} | {locations checked} | {paths checked} | {test assets checked} | {none or reason unchecked} | {no issue / finding number} |

## Observed Findings
| # | family_tag | Category | Severity | Location | Issue | Fix Suggestion |
|---|------------|----------|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | test-structure | Coverage | high / medium / low | `src/test.ts:42` | Issue description | Fix suggestion |

## Verification Evidence
- Build: {Verified target, what was checked, and observed result; or state that it was unverified}
- Tests: {Verified target, what was checked, and observed result; or state that it was unverified}
- Functional check: {Verified target, what was checked, and observed result; or state that it was unverified}

## Unverified Scope
| Item | Reason | Impact on Decision |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| {Unverified scope, or "none"} | {Reason it was not verified} | {APPROVE allowed / REJECT reason} |

## Rejection Gate
- REJECT is valid only when at least one blocking finding is observed
```

**Cognitive load reduction rules:**
- APPROVE: Summary, unverified scope, and only the checked criteria and verification evidence required for a follow-up review (concisely aggregated)
- REJECT: Include every verified finding in tables and aggregate locations with the same cause
